# Spymastergame AI

Spymastergame AI is an innovative web application that generates and displays customizable boards for the popular board game [Codenames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codenames_(board_game)). Our unique approach sets us apart from other online Codenames apps by allowing users to input five categories, which are then used to construct the game board with relevant words.

## Key Features

- **Category-based Board Generation**: Users can enter 5 categories of their choice, making each game more engaging and personalized.
- **Shareable Boards**: Generated boards can be easily shared with other players.
- **Real-time Updates**: The board automatically updates as words are revealed during gameplay.
- **Dual View Modes**: Players can toggle between spymaster and regular player views.

## How It Works

1. Enter 5 categories of your choice
2. Our AI generates a Codenames board using words related to your categories
3. Share the board with your friends
4. Play as either a spymaster or a regular player
5. Enjoy a unique and engaging Codenames experience!
